I am a PhD student at Inria Paris, in the [Argo team](https://argo-project-team.github.io/) and at [DI ENS PARIS](https://www.di.ens.fr/).
I am working under the supervision of [Marc Lelarge](https://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/) on machine learning and physical systems.

You can find more information about my curriculum [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}).
