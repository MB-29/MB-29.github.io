I'm a doctoral candidate at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science){:target="\_blank"}, Aalto University, Finland. A member of [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/){:target="\_blank"} research group, supervised by [Harri Lähdesmäki](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/harrila/){:target="\_blank"}. Before that, I worked with [Taylan Cemgil](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/){:target="\_blank"} in my Master's degree at Bogazici University, Istanbul. 

I'm trying to understand how continuous-time models can be used in time-series learning, video prediction and reinforcement learning. Curious about the connections with optimal control. My research interests broadly include
- Neural ordinary differential equations
- Generative models
- Reinforcement learning

My name is super easy to pronounce: [chaa-tai](https://forvo.com/word/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay/){:target="\_blank"}.
