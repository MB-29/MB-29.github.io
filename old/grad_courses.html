They provide a compact, meaningful representation of the inputs. Bayesian matrix factorization is a general class of LVMs which factorizes a data matrix into a product of two low-rank matrices. LVMs (and BMF) can be used for many purposes in machine learning, such as clustering, pattern recognition, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and predicting missing values. Latent variable modeling is a very broad research topic. This seminar course provides a gateway to this interesting topic through an introductory lecture for several widely used LVMs (e.g. factor analysis and multi-view learning) and basic principles of the methods as well as discussion of more recent advances in the field.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=19392">Seminar Course on Approximate Bayesian Computation</a>, by <i><a href="https://research.aalto.fi/portal/henri.vuollekoski.html">Henri Vuollekoski</a></i>: 
Approximate Bayesian Computation (a.k.a. ABC, likelihood-free inference) is a new class of computational inference methods that can be used when the likelihood function is difficult to evaluate or unknown, and one has a simulator for generating data that (hopefully) resemble observations when generated with correct parameters. The underlying intuition is that similar model parameters are likely to generate similar data, but the practice is of course a bit more complex. ABC has applications from medicine to particle physics, and is expected to revolutionize computional sciences that cannot apply traditional statistical methods.</p>

We also had a poster session at the end of the semester, where I showed an application of Mixed Memory Markov Models. So, <a href="pdf/547-poster.pdf">here</a> the outcome of this course, or my first poster.</p>

We covered first 9 chapters of Ethem Hoca's <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> book: parametric<i>semiparametric</i>nonparametric methods for classification, regression and clustering, PCA, LDA, decision trees, and HMM's. We also worked on a term project, in which I compared three Markov models, namely, Hidden Markov Model, Mixed Memory Markov Model and Factorial Markov Model. Resulting report is <a href="pdf/544-paper.pdf">here</a>.</p>
