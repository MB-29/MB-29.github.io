- [https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=19524 Special Course on Latent Variable Modeling and Bayesian Matrix Factorization], by /[https://research.aalto.fi/portal/xiangju.qin.html Xiangju Qin]/ and /[https://users.ics.aalto.fi/blomstp2/ Paul Blomstedt]/: Latent variable models (LVMs) are powerful and flexible tools for learning hidden structure underlying data objects in an unsupervised fashion. They provide a compact, meaningful representation of the inputs. Bayesian matrix factorization is a general class of LVMs which factorizes a data matrix into a product of two low-rank matrices. LVMs (and BMF) can be used for many purposes in machine learning, such as clustering, pattern recognition, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and predicting missing values. Latent variable modeling is a very broad research topic. This seminar course provides a gateway to this interesting topic through an introductory lecture for several widely used LVMs (e.g. factor analysis and multi-view learning) and basic principles of the methods as well as discussion of more recent advances in the field.

- [https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=19392 Seminar Course on Approximate Bayesian Computation], by /[https://research.aalto.fi/portal/henri.vuollekoski.html Henri Vuollekoski ]/: 
Approximate Bayesian Computation (a.k.a. ABC, likelihood-free inference) is a new class of computational inference methods that can be used when the likelihood function is difficult to evaluate or unknown, and one has a simulator for generating data that (hopefully) resemble observations when generated with correct parameters. The underlying intuition is that similar model parameters are likely to generate similar data, but the practice is of course a bit more complex. ABC has applications from medicine to particle physics, and is expected to revolutionize computional sciences that cannot apply traditional statistical methods.

- [https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=16996&section=1 Cognitive Science], by /[http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~salah/ Albert Ali Salah]/: An introductory to cognitive science. In each week, we covered a different topic including brain, sensation&cognition, language, attention, learning and memory.

- [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9787379/cmpe58k/index.html Bayesian Statistics & Machine Learning], by /[http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/ Ali Taylan Cemgil]/: The main focus in this course was graphical models, in particular inference and parameter learning in Hidden Markov Model and Kalman Filter. We also had a poster session at the end of the semester, where I showed an application of Mixed Memory Markov Models. So, [pdf/547-poster.pdf here] the outcome of this course, or my first poster.

- [http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ethem/i2ml2e/ Pattern Recognition], by /[http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ethem/ Ethem Alpaydın]/: The course was about traditional machine learning. We covered first 9 chapters of Ethem Hoca's [https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning Introduction to Machine Learning] book: parametric/semiparametric/nonparametric methods for classification, regression and clustering, PCA, LDA, decision trees, and HMM's. We also worked on a term project, in which I compared three Markov models, namely, Hidden Markov Model, Mixed Memory Markov Model and Factorial Markov Model. Resulting report is [pdf/544-paper.pdf here].

- [http://www.ie.boun.edu.tr/?q=courses/ie-515-graphs-and-network-flows Graphs & Network Flows], by /[http://www.ie.boun.edu.tr/?q=faculty/z-caner-ta%C5%9Fk%C4%B1n Caner Taşkın]/: Shortest path, max-flow&min-cut, min cost flow/circulation problems and problems with side constraints were the main subjects. I compared execution times of four different algorithms for maximum flow problem in various types of networks in my term project and [pdf/515-paper.pdf here] is the report.

- [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9787379/cmpe58n/index.html Monte Carlo Methods], by /[http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/ Ali Taylan Cemgil]/: A follow-up course to Bayesian Statistics. We investigated random number generation, rejection sampling, importance sampling, discrete space Markov chains, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs sampler and sequential Monte Carlo. That was I guess my favorite course among all in this list. As a term project, I built Mixed Memory Hidden Markov Model for time series analysis, which is briefly described in [projects.html projects] sections, and implemented parameter learning via Gibbs sampler, Metropolis algorithm and particle filter. [pdf/548-poster.pdf Here] is the my poster.

In particular, we studied multilayer perceptrons, recurrent & convolutional neural networks, kernel machines & support vector machines, mixture of experts and reinforcement learning. My term project was about clustering and prediction in time series. I implemented self organized maps and hierarchical clustering for the first part and 4 types of neural networks for the second part: /Tapped-delay multilayer perceptron/, /Elman RNN/, /Full lag Elman RNN/ and /Tapped-delay Jordan RNN/.

We designed agents that plays [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor splendor] in Prolog.

The requirements were different than courses in our department, so we took 3 exams and no term project. We covered branching processes, random walks, Markov chains and Poisson processes in this course.
